### Technical

- The following webpages are added to the portfolio: Home and about.
- To track the working of the project and the changes made on each step, I used Git as the version
  controller. I have made several changes creating the developer branch and I can see those changes on Git.
- The portfolio project is pushed to the remote Git repository. The project is deployed on Github where
  we can make changes by navigating the directory that contains the deployed website.
- Use media queries for responsive design so that the design can be effectively visible on desktop,
  mobile phone, and any other device as per the screen size.
- To define different parts of the HTML page, sematic HTML tags like: header, nav, article, div, section are used.

### Bonus

- Button containers are used in CSS files defining the cursor shape, color on select, color on and after hover. Those containers are reused for different elements.
